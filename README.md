# Sentiment Analysis with LIME Model Explanations

This project showcases how to apply **sentiment analysis** using **Hugging Face transformers** and interpret model predictions with **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)**. It predicts the sentiment of a given text and explains the rationale behind the model's prediction.

## üìã Project Overview

The goal of this project is to use cutting-edge transformer models for sentiment classification and provide **model interpretability** through LIME. This allows users to understand why a model made a specific prediction on a given text.

- **Sentiment Prediction**: Text is classified into sentiments like **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**.
- **LIME Explanations**: Provides visual and interpretive insights into model decision-making.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

- **Hugging Face Transformers**: For pre-trained models like BERT or GPT.
- **LIME**: To explain and visualize the model's prediction process.
- **PyTorch**: For model training and evaluation.
- **Scikit-learn**: For additional metrics and evaluations.
- **Colab**: For running and visualizing code interactively.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to run this project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Busrara/lime-sentiment-explanations
   cd sentiment-analysis-lime-explanation
